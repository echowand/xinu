This directory contains a version of the forwarding code with NAT
removed.  It also contains TFTP, and could server as the basis
for xboot.

We need to clean up the IP code to handle output correctly.


Right now, the main program is still set up to call the tftp
code.  The IP address of the TFTP server in the Xinu lab is
hardwired (see tftp.h), as is the name of a file to download.
